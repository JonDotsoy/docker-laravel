# What is Laravel?


Laravel is a free, open-source PHP web application framework, created by Taylor Otwell and intended for the development of web applications following the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern. Prominent Laravel features include its expressive syntax, a modular packaging system with a dedicated dependency manager, different ways for accessing relational databases, and various utilities that aid in application deployment and maintenance.
